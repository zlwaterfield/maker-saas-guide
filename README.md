# Maker SaaS Guide
The goal of the repository is to outline the best products and practices to use when building SaaS products. The target demographic is makers who are building one or more bootstrapped SaaS products for the web. This is a work in progress based on the experiences of real makers. The content is meant to act as a template/handbook on how to launch a SaaS product from both a technical and operational standpoint. It will cover topics like technical stack, hosting, email providers, payment providers, customer service solutions, terms of service generation, etc.

## Criteria
It is important to be intentional about your decisions when launching a SaaS product. You want to think ahead about what your goals are and use those to steer your decisions. You need to be efficient and conscious in order to make sure you are always working towards those goals. 

_The goal of this guide is to help you create a profitable, low operational product while not comprising on the security of your users' data._

Everything that is recommended in this guide is taking into account that goal based on 3 core criteria that, in my opinion, should be your most important things to optimize when building your SaaS product:
  1. Price - The guide will look for solutions that are affordable. When launching a SaaS product it is important to keep the burn low so this guide will try to keep the initial spend under $50/month.
  2. Ease of integration and management - When thinking about launching a product I think about having the least time to integrate and how much time it will take to manage after the launch. This guide will optimize for both while not losing out on performance and/or reliability.
  3. Security and data privacy - This is a category that a lot sadly dismiss but this guide will focus on it. While the price is important we do not want our users' data to be sold or have the risk of being leaked so using services that care about data compliance and security is important.
